## To-Do 
* <strike>Figure out how to send multiple bytes to arduino</strike>
* <strike>Figure out how to store data into the histogram structure and separate the way it is stored based on the time intervals (what time intervals? how to differentiate?)</strike>
* <strike>Figure out outlier readings, flash warning on LCD when outlier reading comes up</strike> 
* <strike>Make print method for histogram structure</strike>
* Figure out why write pauses up randomly (might be broken heart rate sensor)
* Document explaining communication protocol / schema (check project description)

* Fritzing 
* Use UNC mmap video to mmap histogram structure into virtual memory space
* Turn the 2D into a 1D array before mmaping 
* New heart rate sensor 
* Make sure high and low commands display warnings on LCD 
* Fix print histogram method to actually print histogram
* Make sure requesting heart rate every second works
